This is the site at https://binver.org/ that describes the Binary Versioning specification.

## Adding a translation

1. Create a new folder in `lang/` with the appropriate language tag
2. Add a translated `index.md` to that folder
3. Add a translated `spec/vX.X.X.md` for the latest spec to that folder
4. Ensure all files have the appropriate `title` and `language` front matter (see others as an example)
5. Add the language to the `_config.yml` file
